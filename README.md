This is the final project for the course on ai models for physics.
It is a simple case study on physics informed neural networks. In particular, I studied one of the simplest dynamical system: the damped harmonic oscillator. 
For better visualisation, I studied the model in phase space by reducing the second order differential equation to a system of first order ones.
In practical applications it is more straightforward to add the implicit form of the differential equation as a regulariosation term.
